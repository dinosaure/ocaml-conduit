(** Implementation of TCP protocol using [Lwt_unix]. *)

(** Implementation of TCP protocol as a client.

    Behaviours of [Protocol] differs from {i syscall} provided by [Lwt_unix].
    This is a description of what they currently do.

    {b NOTE}: [recv] wants to fill the given buffer as much as possible until it
    has reached {i end-of-input}. In other words, [recv] can do a multiple call
    to [Lwt_unix.recv] to fill the given buffer.

    {b NOTE}: [send] tries to send as much as it can the given buffer. However,
    if internal call of [Lwt_unix.send] returns something smaller than what we
    requested, we stop the process and return how many byte(s) we sended. In
    other word, [send] can do a multiple call to [Lwt_unix.send] until we fully
    sended what we wanted. *)
